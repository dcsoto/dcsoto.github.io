_**I study what makes the human brain unique by comparing it to the brains of non-human primates, uncovering genetic and epigenetic changes that shaped our evolution and may reveal why we're vulnerable to neuropsychiatric disorders.**_

My research focuses on elucidating genetic and epigenetic changes contributing to human brain evolution and neuropsychiatric disease risk. To do so, I integrate human genetics with population, comparative, and functional genomic approches, across humans and non-human primates. My current research areas include:

**(1) Genetic and epigenetic changes contributing to human brain evolution**

Gene duplications are a key driver of evolutionary innovation, but they are often misrepresented in references genomes. I co-led the characterization of segmentally duplicated regions across the first-ever complete human genome. Leveraging this complete human reference, I then co-led a comprehensive survey of recent human gene duplications. This work identified approximately 350 neurodevelopmental genes and highlighted two that increase brain size in zebrafish. I also helped characterize the epigenetic landscape and expression patterns of 75 duplicated genes across diverse human tissues. In addition, I contributed to characterizing a gene implicated as a human-specific modifier of neuronal excitability.

**(2) Primate comparative genomics and epigenomics**

To fully understand human evolution, comparative approaches across the great apes—human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan—and other non-human primates are essential. Complex structural variation, a key contributor to primate evolution, has remained an underexplored source of species divergence due to the limitations of short-read sequencing technologies. By harnessing long-read sequencing, I have comprehensively identified novel complex genetic variants in chimpanzees and characterized a gene involved in local malaria adaptation among wild chimpanzee populations. Beyond genetic variation, the evolution of gene regulation is a major factor in phenotypic differences among primates. My current work focuses on gene expression evolution, using comparative neurogenomic approaches across primates spanning ~40 million years of evolutionary history.

**(3) The genetics of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders**

The evolution of the uniquely human brain has also given rise to neurodiversity, some of which contributes to neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. I have collaborated on several studies exploring the genetic basis of autism spectrum disorders and behavioral genetics, including the characterization of a structural variant associated with autism risk, the investigation of the epigenetic landscape of chromosome 15q11-q13 linked to Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, and the study of the genetics of behavior in rodents.
