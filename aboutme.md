title: About me
---

I am researcher and bioinformatician in human genomics and neurogenetics. My research interests include elucidating ape- and human-specific genetic changes that led to our complex brain structure, behaviors, and neurodiversity.

Currently, I am postdoctoral scholar in the lab of [Dr. Jonathan Flint](https://bri.ucla.edu/people/jonathan-flint/), UCLA, where I am studying the impact of genes on behavior using single-cell multi-omics data in mouse. Previously, I was a graduate student researcher and postdoctoral scholar in the lab of [Dr. Megan Dennis](https://www.dennislab.org/) at UC Davis, where I studied the role of structural variation in brain evolution and neurodevelopmental disorders using both short- and long-read sequencing technologies. I also worked as a bioinformatics research assistant at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile in the Plants Systems Biology Lab.

I was born in Santiago, Chile. Currently, I live in California, USA, with my husband.
